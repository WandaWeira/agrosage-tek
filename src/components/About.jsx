        Agrosage Tek Uganda Limited (ATUL) is dedicated to eradicating poverty
        among smallholder farmers in Uganda by reducing postharvest losses. Our
        innovative approach involves the establishment of communal cold storage
        facilities known as "Fresh Stops" that operate on air conditioner-based
        cooling systems powered by solar energy. These facilities maintain
        optimal temperature and humidity conditions to preserve agricultural
        products, significantly reducing food waste. Our mission is to empower
        underprivileged farmers to earn decent returns on their investments
        while revolutionizing the agricultural supply chain to meet consumer
        demand for high-quality products. We achieve this by offering a holistic
        postharvest service package, including providing access to cold storage
        services to reduce losses, enabling direct sales to consumers through
        e-commerce, and maximizing farmers' profits by adding value to their
        products.
